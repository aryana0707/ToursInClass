		There is a tour and travel agency who is planning to 
		become a market leader by automating its human travel 
		agents and organization with an automated tour and travel 
		system for processing flight reservations, booking hotels,
		booking vehicles and trains and holiday packages. 
		This automated travelling system will intermediate 
		between travelers and the computing system, which 
		interfaces with commercial hotel package booking, 
		reservation services in flights as well as train. 
		Like a human travel agent, it will assist travelers in 
		booking, changing, and canceling flight reservations.
